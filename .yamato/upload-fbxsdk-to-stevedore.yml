#
# When Autodesk releases a new version of FBX SDK, to update the pacakge to it:
# 1) Create a branch of the repo like "update-to-2020-3-4"
# 2) Create the folder fbxsdk_to_upload at the root of the repo.
# 3) Push the branch.
# 4) On each platform:
#    a) install FBX SDK using the installer
#    b) pull the branch
#    c) windows:
#         py -3 .yamato/zip-fbxsdk.py "/c/Program Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX SDK/2020.3.4"
#         git commit fbxsdk_to_upload/fbxsdk-win-x64.7z
#    d) mac:
#         python .yamato/zip-fbxsdk.py "/Applications/Autodesk/FBX SDK/2020.3.4"
#         git commit fbxsdk-mac-x64.7z
#    e) linux: On linux, user needs to specify where to install FBX SDK, for example at "/usr/FBX202034_FBXFILESDK_LINUX"
#         python .yamato/zip-fbxsdk.py "/usr/FBX202034_FBXFILESDK_LINUX"
#         git commit fbxsdk-linux-x64.7z
# 5) Before uploading fbxsdk zip files which reside in "fbxsdk_to_upload" folder to Stevedore, we need to test them first.
#    This can be done by using "--fbxsdk" flag to point to the unzipped fbxsdk when running build.py, then CI will run using the local fbxsdk.
# 6) If CI passes using local fbxsdk, SET fbxsdk_version correctly in global.metafile and manually run the yamato upload job "upload_fbxsdk_to_stevedore" on this branch.
#     e.g. 2020.3.4
# 7) Check the logs to find the upload name including GUID and update fbxsdk_artifact_id in the CMakeLists.txt accordingly.
#
# Notes: fbxsdk_to_upload folder together with all contents in it shouldn't be merged into master branch.
#        Only the fbxsdk_version update in global.metafile and fbxsdk_artifact_id change in CMakeLists.txt need to be merged into master branch.
#
# Revert to 22a593b45e074c1bc9e7095e958ae4a5d7376a5a to get the legacy
# behaviour used before FBX SDK 2020.3.4 (you would lose win/arm64 and gain mac/intel/10.13)
#

# Starting from version 2020.3.4, fbxsdk on windows provides libraries for both x64 and arm64 platforms; on mac, fbxsdk is an universal one.
# But in stevedore we still put windows fbxsdk under "fbxsdk-win-x64" folder and mac fbxsdk under "fbxsdk-mac-x64".
# This is a legacy issue. We don't want to create too many folders for fbxsdk in Stevedore.
