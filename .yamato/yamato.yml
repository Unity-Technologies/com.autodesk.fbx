#
# Trigger all tests (including promotion tests) on any pull request.
#
# Dependency graph:
# promote (to the production server)
#  . publish (to the candidates server)
#    . test on each platform x editor version
#       . pack (see below)
#    . promotion tests on one fixed platform
#       . pack (see below)
# pack
#  . build on each platform
#
# The tests are triggered on every push to a pull request branch.
# That means build and package are run on those events as well.
#
# Publish and promote must be run manually.
#
# On windows and mac, the full build gets run but we only grab the binaries.
# The basic packages are set up on linux.
#
# Note that I have the platforms listed up top and a list of platforms below
# and they repeat, because variable definitions can't use variables. If you
# change one, change both! (Hopefully yamato handles this soon)
