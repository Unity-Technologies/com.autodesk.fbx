# Contributing

## If you are interested in contributing, here are some ground rules:
* Discuss the issue you want to solve with others. Make sure it fits with others' needs.
* Include a link to a discussion of the issue you're solving.
* Submit a pull request via github.
* It helps if your pull request is small and tidy. Fix only one thing per pull request.
* Make sure to include tests. If you're fixing a bug, include a regression test -- a test that failed before your contribution.
* Make sure all tests pass.
