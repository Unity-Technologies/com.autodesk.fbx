# FbxSharp Project : FBX SDK C# bindings

The FBX SDK C# bindings are available in Unity 2018.3 or later via the `com.autodesk.fbx` package in the Package Manager.

The bindings were built to support the Fbx Exporter package (`com.unity.formats.fbx`).

The bindings are a subset of the FBX SDK, and in particular they do not support all that you would need for a general-purpose importer.

# Building from source

## Requirements

* [Unity](http://unity3d.com) 2018.4
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.12
* [swig](http://www.swig.org/download.html) 3.0.12 -- note that 4.0 is *not* compatible.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7.x or 3.x
* Windows: [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* macOS: macOS 10.15 or later with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/) 12.x with command-line tools installed
* Linux: not supported

Newer versions of each software likely also work, except as noted.

### Windows

When installing Visual Studio, make sure to install C# sdk, C++ sdk, and Universal Windows App Development Tools (this can be done by doing a custom install or
relaunching the installer and selecting "Modify").

### OSX, Linux, or Windows:

```bash
# get the source
git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.autodesk.fbx.git
cd com.autodesk.fbx
python build.py
```

## Overview

**Writing C# code**
```
// Using FbxSdk Assembly

using FbxSdk;

// global functions found in FbxSdk.Globals
var a = FbxSdk.Globals.FbxGetDataTypeNameForIO(b);

var sdkManager = FbxManager.Create();

sdkManager.Destroy();
```

### Running Tests

1. Create a new 3d project in Unity.
2. Copy the `build/install/com.autodesk.fbx` folder into the `Packages` folder of the new project.
3. Use Window > General > Test Runner to run tests

### API Documentation

After compiling, the documentation will be in
```
FbxSharp/build/docs/html/index.html
```
Or in zipped form in
```
FbxSharp/build/install/com.autodesk.fbx/Documentation~/docs.zip
```

In the Unity package, the documentation is packaged as the zip file.

### Reporting Bugs

Please create a minimal Unity project that reproduces the issue and use the Unity Bug Reporter (built in to the Unity Editor).
